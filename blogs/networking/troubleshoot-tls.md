# TLS step by step

1. Handshake Initiation:
   - The client sends a ClientHello message to the server, indicating the supported TLS versions, cipher suites, and other parameters.
   - The server responds with a ServerHello message, selecting the TLS version, cipher suite, and other parameters for the secure connection.

2. Certificate Exchange:
   - The server sends its digital certificate, which contains its public key, to the client.
   - The client verifies the server's certificate, checking its validity, authenticity, and integrity. It may also validate the certificate chain, including the issuer's certificate.

3. Key Exchange:
   - The client generates a pre-master secret and encrypts it using the server's public key.
   - The server decrypts the pre-master secret using its private key and derives the session keys for encryption and decryption.

4. Authentication:
   - The server may request client authentication, depending on the configured TLS parameters.
   - If client authentication is required, the client sends its digital certificate to the server for verification.

5. Session Key Establishment:
   - Both the client and server use the shared session keys derived from the pre-master secret to establish symmetric encryption for the session.
   - The session keys are used for encrypting and decrypting data exchanged during the secure communication.

6. Data Transfer:
   - With the secure session established, the client and server can now exchange encrypted data.
   - All data transmitted between them is encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.

7. Connection Closure:
   - Either the client or server can initiate the closure of the TLS connection.
   - The party initiating the closure sends a close_notify message to signal the intent to close the connection.
   - Both parties acknowledge the close_notify message and close the connection gracefully.

TLS provides a secure layer on top of the underlying transport protocol (typically TCP) for encrypted communication. The handshake process ensures the negotiation of encryption parameters, certificate verification, key exchange, and the establishment of secure session keys. This allows for secure and confidential communication between the client and server, protecting the integrity and privacy of the data exchanged.

# TLS troubleshoot commands  

1. openssl:
   - `openssl s_client -connect <host:port>`: Initiates an SSL/TLS connection to a specific host and port and provides detailed information about the SSL/TLS negotiation process.
   - `openssl x509 -in <certificate_file> -text`: Displays detailed information about an SSL/TLS certificate, including subject, issuer, validity dates, and public key.

2. nmap:
   - `nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p <port> <host>`: Scans for supported SSL/TLS cipher suites on a specific host and port, helping identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - `nmap --script ssl-cert -p <port> <host>`: Retrieves and displays SSL/TLS certificate information for a specific host and port.

3. ssldump:
   - `ssldump -i <interface>`: Captures and displays SSL/TLS traffic on a specific interface for detailed analysis of the handshake and encryption processes.

4. wireshark:
   - `wireshark`: Launches the Wireshark network protocol analyzer, allowing you to capture and inspect SSL/TLS packets in detail.
   - Wireshark filters for TLS/SSL traffic: Use various filters like `ssl`, `tls.handshake`, or `ssl.record` to focus on specific aspects of TLS/SSL communication.

5. curl:
   - `curl -v https://<URL>`: Performs an HTTPS request to the specified URL and displays verbose output, including SSL/TLS negotiation details.

6. ssllabs-scan:
   - `ssllabs-scan <host>`: Conducts a comprehensive assessment of an SSL/TLS server configuration, providing detailed information about supported protocols, cipher suites, and potential vulnerabilities.

7. gnutls-cli:
   - `gnutls-cli --insecure -p <port> <host>`: Initiates a TLS connection to a specific host and port, ignoring certificate validation errors, and displays debugging information.

These commands can assist in diagnosing and troubleshooting various aspects of TLS-related issues, including SSL/TLS handshake problems, certificate validation errors, cipher suite compatibility, and overall SSL/TLS configuration.
